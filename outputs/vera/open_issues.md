## NEW OPEN — Run 204 | 2026-06-13

### OPEN — Commercial/Wholesale Nursery & Greenhouse Production Facilities (Segment #198)
- **Status:** Code live — titles + org keywords in `lead_pipeline.py` + `mixmax.py`; first pull Lake County June 15 (2 days)
- **Files updated:** `workers/lead_pipeline.py` (DANNY_TITLES + DANNY_ORG_KEYWORDS), `integrations/mixmax.py` (PROPERTY_MANAGER_TITLES), `agents/danny.md` (Run 204 batching note)
- **Key targets:** Willoway Nurseries, Lake County Nursery Exchange, Berns Nurseries, Heritage Farm Nurseries; Ohio Dept. of Agriculture nursery dealer licensing compliance angle; $2K-$8K/facility; quarterly = $8K-$32K/year; zero competitors cold-calling wholesale nursery ops managers
- **Lake County angle:** Lake County is Ohio's "Nursery Capital" with 200+ commercial/wholesale nurseries — this segment has higher concentration here than any other county
- **Resolution:** Pull fires June 15. Mark resolved when nursery/greenhouse contacts appear in Nina's report.

### OPEN — danny.md File Size Bloat (Technical Debt)
- **First seen:** 2026-06-13 (Run 204)
- **Description:** `agents/danny.md` is 466KB (2,310 lines) — exceeds the 256KB tool read limit. Every new segment adds 200-400 words of documentation directly to danny.md. When Claude activates Danny, it cannot read the full file. The most recent segments are at the bottom — which means the most critical current instructions may be invisible.
- **Root cause:** Each run adds full segment documentation (why, revenue math, pitch angle, Apollo titles, org keywords, distinct-from) directly inline in the agent file rather than referencing a separate segment library.
- **Impact:** MEDIUM-HIGH — Danny activation may miss recent segments and current batching notes; risk grows with each run
- **Proposed fix:** Archive all segment documentation blocks (runs 87-197) to `docs/commercial_segments_archive.md`. Keep in `danny.md`: core instructions, last 3 batching notes, and a pointer to the archive. This would reduce danny.md to ~15KB.
- **Attempts:**
  - 2026-06-13 (Run 204): Identified and logged. Added compact batching note (no full docs block) to prevent further growth. Proposed fix to Bradley in pending_slack_messages.md.

## Previously NEW OPEN — Run 203 | 2026-06-12

### OPEN — General Aviation (FBO) & Private Airport Terminals (Segment #197)
- **Status:** Code live — first pull Lake County June 15 (Willoughby Hopkins Airport/LNN is Day-1 priority)
- **Files updated:** `workers/lead_pipeline.py` (DANNY_TITLES + DANNY_ORG_KEYWORDS), `integrations/mixmax.py` (PROPERTY_MANAGER_TITLES), `agents/danny.md` (Run 203 batching note)
- **Also fixed:** Duplicate brewery/taproom entries in Segment #196 block removed from both lead_pipeline.py and mixmax.py (run 129 titles were duplicated by run 202)

- **Resolution:** Pull fires June 15. Mark resolved when FBO/aviation contacts appear in Nina's report.

### BUG FIX — Segment #196 Duplicate Titles (Run 203)
- **Status:** RESOLVED this run
- **Issue:** Run 202 re-added 5 titles already in PROPERTY_MANAGER_TITLES from run 129 ('brewery manager', 'taproom manager', 'craft brewery manager', 'brewery operations manager', 'taproom director')
- **Fix:** Removed duplicates from run 202 block in both `lead_pipeline.py` and `integrations/mixmax.py`; kept unique new titles only ('brewery director', 'production brewery manager', 'beverage facility manager', 'brewery owner')

## 🚨 CRITICAL BLOCKER — Gas Station + Fleet Washing Mixmax Sequences (Day 23+)

- **First seen:** 2026-05-15 (Run ~55)
- **Status:** OPEN — both sequences still `'id': 'PENDING'` in `integrations/mixmax.py` lines 47–58
- **Impact:** All gas station + fleet washing contacts Danny has pulled since May 15 are sitting in `contacts_cache.json` unenrolled. They received NOTHING. This includes contacts pulled in Summit (Week 21), Medina (Week 22), and Cuyahoga (Week 24 — June 8 today). Every week they sit unenrolled = lost peak season window.
- **What's needed:** 5 minutes in Mixmax UI:
  1. Go to app.mixmax.com → Sequences → New Sequence
  2. Create: "Forest City Power Washing — Gas Station & C-Store Outreach"
  3. Copy the sequence ID from the URL
  4. Paste into `integrations/mixmax.py` line 54 (replace `'PENDING'`)
  5. Repeat for Fleet: "Forest City Power Washing — Fleet Washing Outreach" → line 48
  6. Run `python3 workers/lead_pipeline.py pending` to enroll the waiting contacts
- **Last attempt Run 203 (NEW ANGLE):** Previous guides described WHAT to do — not HOW with specific copy. This run delivers the COMPLETE email sequence text (3 touches each, both sequences) to `outputs/vera/gas_fleet_sequence_copy_2026-06-12.md`. Bradley can paste directly without writing anything. Reduces friction to: open Mixmax → create shell → paste 3 emails per sequence → copy IDs → replace PENDING. **Day 28.** Lake County pull fires June 15 — 3 days away. All Lake County gas/fleet contacts will be unenrolled without this fix.
